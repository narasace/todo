todo
====

A simple to-do-list app using Node.js and tweeter bootstrap css

==========

Database chosen was MongoDB, ie, non-relational. To deploy to Heroku, PostGre is needed and thus appropriate modules need to be added

==========

First start MongoDB on local machine and then run app.js. The app was designed to be open to all interfaces thus any computer on local network can access it with the server's IP on port 3000
